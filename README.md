A simple [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) client.

## Why?

There are a few clinets for the Gemini protocol for Windows, however, there doesn't seem to be anything native, that doesn't relying on some existing technology - for example, translating responses into a web browser.
This is a wonderful oppotunity to both learn the MAUI framework, understand the Gemini protocol and provide a high-quality client. Using the MAUI framework, cross compatibility can be acheived.

As the project progresses, it gives others the oppotunity to understand the implementation of various frameworks, tools and technologies that can be utilised.

To get started, download the source, fire up Visual Studio 2022 and hit the run button :)
